Description

List.h is the header file for most of the functions in List.c and lets Lex.c use those functions.

List.c is the implementation file for the List ADT and contains the functions to manipulate the ADT.

ListTest.c is a tester file to ensure that the functions in List.c work.

Lex.c is the main program and takes two files, one input and one output, and arrange the output file in lexicographic order of the input file.
The input and output files have to have the same amount of lines.
Lex.c will utilize the files List.h and List.c to sort the lines.

Makefile compiles the files, Lex.c, List.c, List.h, and ListTest.c into an executable.

README is this file and gives a list and description of all the files submitted.
