Description

List.c is the implementation file for the List ADT and contains the functions to manipulate the list ADT.

List.h is the header file for most of the functions in List.c and lets Graph.c and FindPath.c use those functions.

Graph.c is implementation file for the Graph ADT and contains the functions to manipulate the graph ADT.

Graph.h is the header file for most of the functions in List.c and lets Graph.c and FindPath.c use those functions.

GraphTest.c is a file that tests the functions in Graph.c.

FindPath.c is the main program and takes two files, one input and one output.

The input file has two parts.  The first part starts with a line stating the number of vertices in the graph
and every following line represents and edge by a pair of different numbers.  The two parts are seperated by "0 0".
The second part will consist of a number of lines that each compose of a pair of integers in the range of the 
number of vertices.  The first interger of the pain represnts the source and the second interger represnts the 
destination.  The second part also ends with "0 0".

The output file prints out a list of every node and what they are adjacent to and prints a path and distance of nodes.

Makefile compiles the files List.c, List.h, Graph.c, Graph.h, GraphTest.c, and FindPath.c into an executable.

README is this file and gives a list and description of all the files submitted.


How to Run

With all the files in the same directory type in "make" to make the FindPath executable, "make GraphClient" to 
make the GraphClient executable, and "make GraphTest" to make the GraphTest executable.

To run the executable type in "./<file_name>" without the file extension.

The FindPath executable requires two text files for it to run which mean you have to type

"./FindPath <text_file> <text_file>"

Type "make clean" to remove all binaries and executables.

Type "make checkFind" to test FindPath for memory leaks, type "make checkClient" to test GraphClient for memory leaks,
and type "make checkTest" to test GraphTest for memory leaks
