Description

README is this file and gives a list and description of all the files submitted.

Makefile compiles the files List.h, List.cpp, ListTest.cpp, and Shuffle.cpp into an executable.

List.h is the header file for most of the functions in List.cpp and lets Sparse.cpp use those functions.

List.cpp is the implementation file for the List ADT and contains the functions to manipulate the list ADT.

ListTest.cpp is a file that tests the functions in List.cpp.

Shuffle.cpp is the main program and takes a single command line arguement, a positive number (n), that will specify the 
max number of cards in the deck.  It will print out a table that states the deck size (1 to n) and how many perfect shuffles
it takes until the original order is restored.


How to Run

With all the files in the same directory type in "make" to make the Shuffle executable, 
and "make ListTest" to make the ListTest executable.

To run the executable type in "./<file_name>" without the file extension.

The Shuffle executable requires a single command line argument meaning you will have to enter

"./Shuffle <number>"

Type "make clean" to remove all binaries and executables.

Type "make check2" to test Shuffle for memory leaks, type "make check3" to test ListTest for memory leaks.
It will make a txt file that has the output of valgrind.
