Description

Arithmetic.cpp is the main program and takes two files, one input and one output.
The input file contains 3 lines, the first line has an optional sign character (+ or −) 
followed by any number of decimal digits, the second line is a blank line, 
and the third line has an optional sign character (+ or −) followed by any number of decimal digits.

BigInteger.cpp is the implementation file for the BigInteger ADT and contains 
the functions to manipulate the BigInteger ADT.

BigInteger.h is the header file for most of the functions in BigInteger.cpp and 
lets Arithmetic.cpp use those functions.

BigIntegerTest.cpp is a file that tests the functions in BigInteger.cpp.

List.cpp is the implementation file for the List ADT and contains 
the functions to manipulate the List ADT.

List.h is the header file for most of the functions in List.cpp and 
lets BigInteger.cpp and Arithmetic.cpp use those functions.

ListTest.cpp is a file that tests the functions in List.cpp.

Makefile is this file and gives a list and description of all the files submitted.

README is this file and gives a list and description of all the files submitted.


How to Run

With all the files in the same directory type in "make" to make the Arithmetic executable, 
type "make BigIntegerTest" to make the BigIntegerTest executable and type "make ListTest" 
to make the ListTest executable,.

To run the executable type in "./<file_name>" without the file extension.

The Arithmetic executable requires two text files for it to run which mean you have to type

"./Arithmetic <text_file> <text_file>"

Type "make clean" to remove all binaries and executables.

Type "make ArithmeticCheck" to run Arithmetic in valgrind, 
type "BigIntegerCheck" to run BigIntegerTest in valgrind,
and type "make ListCheck" to run ListTest in valgrind.
