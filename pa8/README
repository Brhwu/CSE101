Description

README is this file and gives a list and description of all the files submitted.

Makefile compiles the files Dictionary.h, Dictionary.cpp, DictionaryTest.cpp, and Order.cpp into an executable.

Dictionary.h is the header file for the functions in Dictionary.cpp and lets Order.c use those functions.

Dictionary.cpp is the implementation file for the Dictionary ADT and contains the functions to manipulate the Dictionary ADT.

DictionaryTest.cpp is a file that tests the functions in Dictionary.cpp.

Order.cpp is one of the two top-level clients and takes two files, one input and one output.

The input file will have each line be a unique single string that will used as keys in the dictionary.
The line number in the input file where the string was read will be the corresponding value.

The output file will contain two string representations of the Dictionary with the first string
consisting of pairs in the form

"key : value\n"

and will be in alphabetical order.
The second string will consist of keys, one line at a time, in the order of a pre-order tree walk.


WordFrequency.cpp is one of the two top-level clients and takes two files, one input and one output.

Each line in the input file will be read and each word in the line will be read.
All words will be in lower case characters and placed as a key.
The value will be how many times the word/key is read.

The output file will contain a string representation of the Dictionary with the string
consisting of pairs in the form

"key : value\n"

and will be in alphabetical order.


How to Run

With all the files in the same directory type in "make" to make the Order executable, 
and type "make DictionaryTest" to make the DictionaryTest executable.

To run the executable type in "./<file_name>" without the file extension.

The Order and WordFrequency executable requires two text files for it to run which mean you have to type

"./Order <text_file> <text_file>"

or

"./WordFrequency <text_file> <text_file>"

Type "make clean" to remove all binaries and executables.

Type "make OrderCheck" to run Order in valgrind on in5 and junk5,
type "make WordFrequency" to run WordFrequency in valgrind on Gutenberg.txt, and
type "make DictionaryCheck" to run DictionaryTest in valgrind.
