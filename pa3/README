Description

README is this file and gives a list and description of all the files submitted.

Makefile compiles the files List.h, List.c, Graph.h, Graph.c, GraphTest.c, and FindComponents.c into an executable.

List.h is the header file for most of the functions in List.c and lets Graph.c and FindComponents.c use those functions.

List.c is the implementation file for the List ADT and contains the functions to manipulate the list ADT.

Graph.h is the header file for most of the functions in List.c and lets Graph.c and FindComponents.c use those functions.

Graph.c is implementation file for the Graph ADT and contains the functions to manipulate the graph ADT.

GraphTest.c is a file that tests the functions in Graph.c.

FindComponents.c is the main program and takes two files, one input and one output.

The input file starts with a line stating the number of vertices in the graph and every following line represents an
arc with a pair of different numbers.  

The output file prints out an adjacency list of every node in the graph and lists all strongly connected components.

Makefile compiles the files List.h, List.c, Graph.h, Graph.c, GraphTest.c, and FindComponents.c into an executable.


How to Run

With all the files in the same directory type in "make" to make the FindComponents executable, "make GraphClient" to 
make the GraphClient executable, and "make GraphTest" to make the GraphTest executable.

To run the executable type in "./<file_name>" without the file extension.

The FindComponents executable requires two text files for it to run which mean you have to type

"./FindComponents <text_file> <text_file>"

Type "make clean" to remove all binaries and executables.

Type "make checkFind" to test FindComponents for memory leaks, type "make checkClient" to test GraphClient for memory leaks,
and type "make checkTest" to test GraphTest for memory leaks.

Notes

Time is a field in Graph.
